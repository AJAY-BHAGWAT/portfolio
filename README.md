## 🔍 About Me

I'm a results-driven Data Science Master's student at the University of Bath, with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, AWS, Python, and SQL. I bring practical experience in building predictive models, developing data pipelines, and extracting insights to drive informed decision-making.

During my internship at Predictea Digital, I applied machine learning techniques to improve customer targeting and automated reporting systems using Python and SQL. My skill set spans from feature engineering and model tuning to cloud deployment with AWS services like EC2, S3, and Lambda.

I'm passionate about solving complex problems with data, and always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies in the ever-evolving data science space.

Currently open to opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Analytics.
